# Personal Website: toylyol.github.io

- This repository holds the code for my mini website courtesy of GitHub Pages.

- The HTML [template](https://html5up.net/dimension) "Dimension" from HTML5 UP was used.

- The HTML template was edited in Visual Studio Code. These [two](https://themewagon.com/how-to-customize-an-html-template/) [tutorials](https://blog.alanjc.com/articles/how-to-create-and-host-your-first-website-with-github.html) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj6aSYlU9QQ&t=537s) provided excellent instruction on how to edit HTML template to create a personal website using GitHub Pages.
